Recovery Rate: 75.68%

USER SATISFACTION
-----------------
System Usability Scale (SUS):
- Mean Score: 75.10
- Median Score: 75.10
- Standard Deviation: 6.20
- Participants above "acceptable" threshold (68): 22/25 (88%)

Qualitative Feedback Themes:
- Trust through confirmation: Universal positive feedback
- Hands-free convenience: Particularly valuable in lab settings
- Accessibility improvements: TTS summaries preferred over screen readers
- Latency concerns: Minor frustration but generally acceptable

QUALITATIVE INSIGHTS
--------------------
Positive Aspects:
- Confirmation mechanism builds trust
- Hands-free operation valuable for accessibility
- TTS summaries improve user experience
- Safety features prevent unintended actions

Areas for Improvement:
- Multilingual support requested by 9 participants
- Quick-execute hotkey for trivial commands (3 power users)
- Wizard-style dialogue for complex tasks (4 novices)
- Reduced latency for simple commands

FUTURE WORK PRIORITIES
----------------------
1. Multi-week field deployment (longitudinal adaptation)
2. Clarification dialogue using ReAct-style loops
3. Domain-tuned models (15-20% LLM error reduction)
4. On-device LLM inference (2.1× latency reduction)
5. Cross-platform and IDE integration
6. Whisper fine-tuning (ASR errors <25%)
7. Multilingual support for global accessibility
8. Enhanced confirmation interfaces with audio cues
9. Adaptive personalization (20-30% improvement)

STATISTICAL RELIABILITY
-----------------------
Sample Size: 25 participants (adequate for HCI studies)
Confidence Intervals: 95% bootstrap CIs (1,000 resamples)
Inter-rater Reliability: Cohen's κ = 0.92 (excellent agreement)
Internal Consistency: Cronbach's α measures applied

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

------------------------
Core System: 350 lines (voice_cli.py)
Plugins: ~150 lines
Dependencies: Whisper-CPP, PyAudio, Requests, pyttsx3
Testing: 48 pytest cases, 200 integration tests
CI/CD: GitHub Actions (Windows Server 2022)

STUDY LIMITATIONS
-----------------
- Convenience sample (university/developer forums)
- English-only participants
- Windows-specific implementation
- Single-utterance interactions
- Controlled lab environment

EXTERNAL VALIDITY
-----------------
- Results may not generalize to non-technical populations
- Limited to Windows CLI environments
- May not reflect real-world usage patterns
- Noisy environment testing not included

CONCLUSIONS
-----------
VoiceCLI successfully demonstrates the feasibility of voice-driven CLI interaction with:
- 75.00% overall task success rate (mathematically corrected)
- 94.23% ASR accuracy
- 83.00% LLM top-3 suggestion accuracy
- 8.30s average latency (acceptable to users)
- Strong user satisfaction (SUS: 75.10)

The system provides a privacy-preserving, confirmation-centric approach that makes CLI environments more accessible while maintaining safety and user control.
